# I2C - Community Recommended Pinout DRAFT 4th Feb 2015 

This is a page for the community recommended i2c pinouts. Currently in draft status, thus is up for discussion still.

-------------------------------

## i2c Header Pins

The most common interface for an i2c pinout is via header pins. But the pin arrangements often change between modules. Hopefully this will help reduce it.

### Layout

#### Full Header Pins Layout

```ascii-diagram
[VCC][SDA][GND][SCL][ V_AUX ][INT1][INT2][INT_etc...]

VCC   : Regulated Input 
        [Warning: Acceptable voltage dependent on module]
SDA   : i2c serial data input/output
GND   : Ground 0V
SCL   : i2c serial clock
V_AUX : Unregulated Auxiliary Power 
        (This input will be regulated to VCC Voltage levels)
INT1,INT2,etc...  :  Interrupt lines
```

#### 4 pins - Reduced Form with direct power input. No interrupts

```ascii-diagram
 [VCC][SDA][GND][SCL]
```


#### 4 pins - Reduced Form with Auxiliary Regulated power Input. No interrupts

```ascii-diagram
 [SDA][GND][SCL][AUX]
```

#### 5 pins - Reduced Form

```ascii-diagram
 [VCC][SDA][GND][SCL][AUX]
``` 

### Layout Justification/Reasoning

This was because according to real life experience by [Samuel from this stack overflow thread on "definitive i2c pinout guide](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/47056/is-there-any-definitive-i2c-pin-out-guidance-out-there-not-looking-for-a-stand) , it makes no real difference to have a certain pattern. This is since i2c is a relatively slow protocol, such that interference between SDA and SCL makes no difference practically. And if you are going long distance, you might as well use a dedicated i2c bus extender.

Samuel suggest `[VCC][SDA][GND][SCL]` as the his recommendation, since it is resistant against incorrect wiring.

## i2c TRRS Pinout

### Layout

```ascii-diagram

i2c TRRS pinout

TIP    : SCL | i2c serial clock signal
RING1  : SDA | i2c serial data input/output
RING2  : VCC | Regulated power input [Warning: Voltage depends on module]
SLEEVE : GND | Ground power input 

```

```ascii-diagram

    TRRS Plug Pin out:

            _____________________________|##
	 /---\_/ |       |       |           |####
	| TIP _  | RING1 | RING2 | SLEEVE    |####}========>
	 \---/ \_|_______|_______|___________|####
                                         |##

	TRRS Receptacle Pin out
	_________________
	SLEEVE           \
	____________      \__________
    RING1       \/               \/    ||
	                                   ||
	                                   ||
	___/\       ________/\             ||
	TIP        /
	__________/
	RING2
	
```



### Justification/Reasoning

A typical TRRS plug will not have twisted pairs, and is not wired flat, so kind of useless to try and pattern it in a specific manner from the plug.

Their wiring pattern is safe enough. Since the VCC pin will not activate until the GND sleeve is inserted. It does mean... don't plug this into a TRS socket.
