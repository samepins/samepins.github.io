# PCB markings

## Small Form Factor:

To mark a board as Conforming to the SamePins specification. At the very minimum, use the keyword:

```

SaPn : General Markings for SamePins. May be full or partial, please consult datasheet.

```

Could add more information on exactly how much (Is that really needed?)

```

!SaPn : Full conformity
~SaPn : Partial conformity

```

It will also be helpful to specify the year of the specification being used.

```

SaPn_2015Q1 : 2015 Quarter 1

SaPn_2015M2 : 2015 February

SaPn_15 : 2015 ( Only valid until the year 21xx )

SaPn_015 : 2015 ( Only valid until the year 3xxx )

```
