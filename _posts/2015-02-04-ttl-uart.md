# TTL UART - Community Recommended Pinout DRAFT 4th Feb 2015 

TTL UART, are serial plugs that are used to communicate to devices and micro controllers using inexpensive hardware (or via bitbanging).

```ascii-diagram
	
	TTL UART general wiring between Device A and B
	
	         | TX  :_____      ___: TX  |
	         |           \    /         |
	         |          ..\../          |
	DEVICE A |         /   \            |  DEVICE B
	         | RX  :__/     \_____: RX  |
	         |                          |
	         | GND :______________: GND |
	
```

```ascii-diagram

	Flow control:
	
	| Output  |  Input |
	  RTS -------> CTS
	  DCE -------> DTE

```

# Header Pins

## 3 Pins :  Un-Powered (Reversible)

```ascii-diagram
[TXD][GND][RXD]
```

## 4 Pins : Powered (Not Reversible)

```ascii-diagram

[TXD][GND][RXD][VCC]
```

## 5 Pins : Powered (Reversible)

```ascii-diagram

[VCC][TXD][GND][RXD][VCC]
```

## 6 Pins : Powered (Not Reversible)

```ascii-diagram

[TXD][GND][RXD][VCC][CTS][RTS]
```

## 7 Pins : Full (Reversible)

```ascii-diagram

[RTS][VCC][TXD][GND][RXD][VCC][CTS]

```

## Justification/Reasoning 

The benefit to this pattern, is that it would be possible to have a cable that can easily swap the TXD and RXD around (like a cross over cable). This allows for swapping TXD and RXD, in a painless manner.

# TRRS

```ascii-diagram

TTL UART via TRS plug (Master):
( On the master device e.g. USB to Serial adaptor )

TIP    : master RX
RING1  : VCC
RING2  : master TX
SLEEVE : Ground 0V


TTL UART via TRS Receptacle ( slave ):
( E.g. UV-3R UHF radio TRRS port ) 

TIP    : slave  TX
RING1  : VCC
RING2  : slave  RX 
SLEEVE : Ground 0V

```

## Justification/Reasoning

Based pinout to UV-3R, due to popularity of the device, and thus the abundance of programming cables for UV-3R. 

## Edits:

* Jan 2015: Switched the order of the device to match the popular UV-3R programming cable (Since it be easier to source such cables as well)

----------------------------

# TRS

```ascii-diagram

TTL UART via TRS plug ( On the master device )

TIP    : master RX
RING   : master TX
SLEEVE : Ground 0V


TTL UART via TRS Receptacle ( slave device )

TIP    : slave  TX
RING   : slave  RX
SLEEVE : Ground 0V

```

## Justification/Reasoning

You'll need to make it clear that you cannot plug a TRRS plug in.

# 6 pin modular connector

```ascii-diagram
	TTL UART 6P6C PORT (Telephone. Pretty rare):
	(6 Possible Contacts, 6 Pin Contacts Used)
	        _____
	      _|     |_
	 ____|         |____
	|                   |
	|                   |
	|                   |
	|_   6 5 4 3 2 1   _|
	
	1: Master RST to Slave CTS
	2: VCC
	3: Master Tx to Slave Rx
	4: Slave Rx to Master Tx
	5: GND
	6: Master CTS to Slave RST

```

## Justification/Reasoning

Since telephone cables are typically untwisted, bundled together and unshielded. There is no real point to any particular arrangement. But there are cables that has only two wires, or 4 wires, that can still be easily sourced from stores. (Thus you want at least most of the important pins between pin 2 to 5)
