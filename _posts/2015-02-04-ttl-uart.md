# TTL UART - Community Recommended Pinout DRAFT 4th Feb 2015 

TTL UART, are serial plugs that are used to communicate to devices and micro controllers using inexpensive hardware (or via bitbanging).

```ascii-diagram
	
	TTL UART general wiring between Device A and B
	
	         | TX  :_____      ___: TX  |
	         |           \    /         |
	         |          ..\../          |
	DEVICE A |         /   \            |  DEVICE B
	         | RX  :__/     \_____: RX  |
	         |                          |
	         | GND :______________: GND |
	
```

# Header Pins

## 3 Pins :  Un-Powered (Reversible)

```ascii-diagram
[TXD][GND][RXD]
```

## 4 Pins : Powered (Not Reversible)

```ascii-diagram

[TXD][GND][RXD][VCC]
```

## 5 Pins : Powered (Reversible)

```ascii-diagram

[VCC][TXD][GND][RXD][VCC]
```

## 6 Pins : Powered (Not Reversible)

```ascii-diagram

[TXD][GND][RXD][VCC][CTS][RTS]
```

## 7 Pins : Full (Reversible)

```ascii-diagram

[RTS][VCC][TXD][GND][RXD][VCC][CTS]

```

## Justification/Reasoning 

The benefit to this pattern, is that it would be possible to have a cable that can easily swap the TXD and RXD around (like a cross over cable). This allows for swapping TXD and RXD, in a painless manner.

# TRRS

```ascii-diagram

TTL UART via TRS plug (Master):
( On the master device e.g. USB to Serial adaptor )

TIP    : master RX (to slave TX)
RING1  : VCC
RING2  : master TX (to slave RX)
SLEEVE : Ground 0V


TTL UART via TRS Receptacle ( slave ):
( E.g. UV-3R UHF radio TRRS port ) 

TIP    : slave  TX
RING1  : VCC
RING2  : slave  RX 
SLEEVE : Ground 0V

```

## Justification/Reasoning

Based pinout to UV-3R, due to popularity of the device, and thus the abundance of programming cables for UV-3R. 

## Edits:

* Jan 2015: Switched the order of the device to match the popular UV-3R programming cable (Since it be easier to source such cables as well)

----------------------------

# TRS

**Recommended to use TRRS version instead, even if unpowered.**

```ascii-diagram

TTL UART via TRS plug:

TIP    : master RX to slave TX
RING   : master TX to slave RX
SLEEVE : Ground 0V

Note: master device are the plug, and slave are the Receptacle. 

```

## Justification/Reasoning

You'll need to make it clear that you cannot plug a TRRS plug in.

## Master Port

If you don't want to create a custom crossover cable...

For a device that will only act as a master, and uses the easy to source unmodified 4 pin telephone cable. You can use this port arrangement instead. E.g. you are making a serial to USB cable. But generally this is not recommended, as you might as well just solder the cable directly to the pcb.

```
	Master/Computer port:
	1: RTS	 - Request To Send
	2: DTR	 - Data Terminal Ready
	3: Tx	 - UART Transmit
	4: VCC	 - Voltage Power Input ( Can be omitted if not powered through cable)
	5: GND	 - Ground Power Input 
	6: Rx	 - UART Receive
	7: DCD	 - Data Carrier Detect
	8: CTS	 - Clear To Send
```
	
## Justification / Reasoning

Since telephone cables are typically untwisted, bundled together and unshielded. There is no real point to any particular arrangement of pins. Still since some are flat flexed, it would be a good idea to at least keep the RX/TX separate from each other. Typically you can easily source 4 conductors telephone cable, which will give you at least the Tx and Rx and power (excluding RTS/CTS flow control).

This mandates a custom cable (or a modified telephone cable), since we are crossing over connections. This would allow for connecting TTL serial devices in any combinations we want.

This has all the pins of a standard FTDI USB to Serial adapter for devices like arduino.

# RJ45 Style Plug (Full Flow Control)

This uses the same plug as an ethernet cable. However the cable used is untwisted.

You will need to make your own custom cable for this method.

## Justification / Reasoning

This wiring standard is inspired by the YOST RS232 wiring standard. The main difference is that unlike the YOST cable, pin 5 and 4 is untwisted. But incidentally since the YOST cabling standard designate both 5&4 as GND, this cable will be backwards compatible with YOST ports.

If you use cat5 cables, you should ensure that the Tx and Rx pins are not twisted together. (e.g. make pin 6:5 and 4:3 a pair). Since VCC is not always powered, you should add some capacitance on both ends of the port for pin 5 & 4.

If you need all the flow control pins that you find in a rs232 device, you should give [YOST SERIAL Standard](http://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/cable/yost-serial-rj45.html) a shot. Be mindful that Yost Serial is an rs232 voltage level signalling standard, so level conversion is required (+-12V).

Do note that naturally, since this is TTL signalling rather than RS232 signals, the maximum cable length is going to be drastically smaller than rs232 cables.

Still the typical use case of this device is short range connection between a computer to an embedded serial console.
