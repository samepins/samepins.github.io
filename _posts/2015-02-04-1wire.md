# 1-wire - Community Recommended Pinout DRAFT 4th Feb 2015 

1-wire is a bus protocol that requires only a single wire to communicate.

While the TRS form is defined below, you are recommended to always use the TRRS form instead over the TRS form (and leave the interrupt pin unconnected if necessary).

# TRS


```ascii-diagram

1-wire via TRS (Plug/Receptacle)

TIP    : 1-wire RX/TX
RING1  : Power VCC
SLEEVE : Ground 0V

```

This form supports 1-wire communication, as well as power to devices. Because it is a bus protocol, you can place these devices on the same line. 

# TTRS

```ascii-diagram

1-wire via TRS plug (Plug/Receptacle)

TIP    : 1-wire RX/TX
RING1  : VCC
RING2  : Interrupt signal From slave to master
         [Recommendation: Add a resistor in case of a short to ground]
SLEEVE : Ground 0V

```

## Justification/Reasoning

Since we defined RING1 as VCC in the **TRS** form already, we want to place the interrupt pin in RING2 so that the TRRS 1-wire plug will still work in both the TRRS and the TRS receptacle. 

Because 1-wire plugs will work on both TRS and TTRS 1-wire receptacles, it is important that a resistor is placed on the output of the interrupt pin of the slave device. This is because a TRRS plug plugged into a TRS receptacle, will have RING2 shorted to SLEEVE.
