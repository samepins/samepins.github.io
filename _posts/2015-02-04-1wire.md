# 1-wire - Community Recommended Pinout DRAFT 4th Feb 2015 

1-wire is a bus protocol that requires only a single wire to communicate.

While the TRS form is defined below, you are recommended to always use the TRRS form instead over the TRS form (and leave the interrupt pin unconnected if necessary).

Cat3 phone sockets is also a good choice for longer connections.

-------------------

# TRS


```ascii-diagram

1-wire via TRS (Plug/Receptacle)

TIP    : Power VCC
RING1  : 1-wire RX/TX
SLEEVE : Ground 0V

```

This form supports 1-wire communication, as well as power to devices. Because it is a bus protocol, you can place these devices on the same line. 

--------------------------------

# TTRS

```ascii-diagram

1-wire via TRS plug (Plug/Receptacle)

TIP    : Power VCC
RING1  : 1-wire RX/TX
RING2  : Interrupt signal From slave to master
         [Recommendation: Add a resistor in case of a short to ground]
SLEEVE : Ground 0V

```

## Justification/Reasoning For TTRS and TRS

Since we defined RING1 as RX/TX in the **TRS** form already, we want to place the interrupt pin in RING2 so that the TRRS 1-wire plug will still work in both the TRRS and the TRS receptacle. 

Why is there no "Aux Power" to inject a higher unregulated voltage? Because there is a risk that during plugging, there would be a short on any pins. This may be fine for lower voltages like 5V, but dangerous for 12v.

Because 1-wire plugs will work on both TRS and TTRS 1-wire receptacles, it is important that a resistor is placed on the output of the interrupt pin of the slave device. 
This is because a TRRS plug plugged into a TRS receptacle, will have RING2 shorted to SLEEVE.

## Justification/Reasoning

Typical Cat3 telephone conductors come in single pair (2 wires) and double pairs (4 wires). 
Since one wire at the minimum supports two conductive wires, 
best to arrange pins to allow for this.

For the full 4 conductive wires cable, best to use the two pins for power. 
One for 5V, since one wire devices rarely require more than 5V (some may be even 3.3V). 
And another for AUX power input, this is intended for sending higher voltage DC input (To be regulated down to device voltage internally), to account for  
resistive losses over the length of an extended line.

# Modifications @ Jan 2015:

* swapped around TRS and TRRS pinout to more closely match DS18S20 pinout (Thus making PCB breakout design simpler).
